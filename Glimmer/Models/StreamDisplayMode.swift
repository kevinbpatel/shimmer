//  StreamDisplayMode.swift
//
//  How the stream is shown (full screen / window) and the pure rules around
//  it: the persisted default, which preset the choice applies to, and the
//  refresh cap a windowed stream takes. Window is part of the CUSTOM preset -
//  Native Retina and HiDPI are panel-native by definition, so they are always
//  full screen; a window uses Custom's own resolution, refresh, bitrate and
//  HDR. Testable without an AppModel, an NSScreen, or a window.
