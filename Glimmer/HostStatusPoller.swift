//  HostStatusPoller.swift
//
//  Background periodic-polling Task for the host readiness chip. Pings the
//  selected host's HTTP port for an RTT, then if reachable pulls /serverinfo
//  to learn idle-vs-busy. Cancellation hooks live on the manager so lifecycle
//  edges (host change, app activation, stream start/end) funnel through
//  `restartHostStatusPolling()`. Originally inline in `AppModel.swift`.
