//
//  AppModel+HostRoute.swift
//
//  Always-on route classification for the SELECTED host - feeds the quiet
//  bolt / Wi-Fi glyph on the launcher's readiness chip ("Ready · 12 ms ⚡").
//
//  DELIBERATELY not the engine's `StreamRouteProbe`: that probe is
//  constructed by the opt-in telemetry exporter (gate-on only) and must stay
//  removable with it - nothing UI-facing may depend on it. This monitor rides
//  pure Network.framework instead: one connected UDP NWConnection to the host
//  (connecting a UDP socket sends NOTHING - it only asks the kernel to bind a
//  route), whose NWPath reports the egress interface class for THAT
//  destination. Path updates are pushed on every route-table event
//  (dock/undock, VPN up, Wi-Fi join), so the glyph flips live with no timers.
//  Idle cost: one parked socket, zero traffic. Unlike the exporter probe we
//  tolerate hostnames here - Network.framework resolves asynchronously off
//  the main thread, and the launcher has no hot path to protect.
