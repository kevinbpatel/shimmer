//  AudioDecoder+CushionMemory.swift
//
//  The cushion LOSS FLOOR + per-host memory - the decay-limit-cycle fix.
//
//  MEASURED FAULT (extended wifi testing): the 60s-quiet decay stepped the
//  target down INTO the link's ambient loss floor, under-ran, re-ratcheted -
//  an audible blip every ~90s of clean play, the under-runs landing at targets
//  the ladder had just walked down from the link's ~80ms equilibrium. A slow
//  limit cycle: the exact disguised-oscillation the decay was meant to avoid,
//  one octave down. Plus several startup blips per session on both links while
//  the ratchet re-derived what the previous session already knew.
//
//  THREE LAYERS, all evidence-keyed, all recovering (no permanent give-ups):
//   (1) NEAR-MISS GATE - a decay step requires the quiet window's MIN fill to
//       have stayed a full step above empty. A trough that came within one
//       step of empty is the same starvation evidence as an under-run, minus
//       the audible event - it holds depth WITHOUT the user paying a blip.
//   (2) LOSS FLOOR - an EWMA of the target at each under-run learns the level
//       this link actually fails at; the decay never steps below floor + one
//       step without the floor itself decaying first. JITTERY-LINK ARGUMENT:
//       the floor adapts BOTH ways - fresh under-runs pull it up immediately
//       (evidence-weighted), and a slow ~10min quiet clock walks it down, so
//       a genuinely improved link re-earns shallow cushions while a link that
//       keeps proving its losses keeps its depth. Even a floor learned at the
//       cap self-heals: each 10min clean window lowers it a step, unblocking
//       the target decay - blocked states always have a clock running.
//   (3) PER-HOST MEMORY - the learned target + floor persist in UserDefaults
//       keyed "host|link" and SEED the
//       next session, so the cold pre-roll builds the depth this host+link
//       needs instead of re-paying the first-minutes ratchet walk. The link
//       is usually unknown at audio bring-up (the route probe feeds ~1-2s
//       later), so the seed starts from the best available record and a
//       one-shot resolve re-keys it when the route lands; if it never lands
//       (telemetry off), learning continues under the init key - the
//       "host|unknown" bucket converges by the same machinery, just unsplit.
//
//  Decay ABOVE the floor is untouched: transient distress spikes still come
//  back down at the same ~10ms/min. Zero host changes; everything here is
//  client-side playout depth policy.
//
//  ITS SIBLING (it guards the same cushion): the DRIFT-TRACKING RESAMPLER - the
//  deterministic clock-skew repayment, plus its per-host skew memory. It used to
//  live here; it now has its own file, AudioDecoder+Resampler.swift, which
//  carries the measured fault and the jittery-link argument.
