//
//  WiFiTelemetry.swift
//
//  The LINK-HONESTY pair for the telemetry rig: the Wi-Fi ASSOCIATION sampler
//  (`WiFiTelemetry`) and the stream-ROUTE probe (`StreamRouteProbe`). Two
//  different questions, kept side by side because conflating them is an easy
//  and costly mistake:
//    * wifi_* fields = "what is the associated Wi-Fi radio doing?" - RSSI,
//      negotiated tx/PHY rate, noise floor, channel/band labels. These describe
//      the RADIO, whether or not the stream rides it.
//    * stream_link / stream_if = "which interface do the stream's packets
//      actually traverse?" - a kernel-routing probe. A docked laptop streams
//      over Thunderbolt Ethernet while STAYING associated to its AP, so
//      wifi_link:"wifi" on every row of a wired session is truthful about the
//      radio yet dead wrong as a route label (route identity would otherwise
//      have to be reconstructed post-hoc from RTT physics). stream_link is the
//      field that GATES the env-signal adaptive layer - radio evidence arms only
//      when the stream really is on the radio.
//
//  GATING + HOT-PATH SAFETY (load-bearing - see TelemetryExporter.swift):
//    * Sampled ONLY on the exporter's ~1Hz capture tick, on its serial queue -
//      NEVER the hot path. There is no per-frame and no per-packet cost.
//    * When telemetry is off (default), the exporter never exists, so this is
//      never constructed and never called: zero overhead.
//    * `CWWiFiClient.shared()` + one `interface()` read per tick is a cheap
//      framework call (no scan triggered - we read the CURRENT association, never
//      `scanForNetworks`, which WOULD disrupt the link). Wrapped so any CoreWLAN
//      hiccup degrades to "no sample" rather than affecting the stream.
//
//  WIRED HANDLING: on Ethernet (or any host with no associated Wi-Fi interface)
//  there is no radio to report, so we emit a clear `wired`/`unassociated` STATE
//  (an enum the renderer turns into a single `glimmer_wifi_link_state` gauge + a
//  `link="wired"` label) and omit the RSSI/rate/noise gauges entirely - an absent
//  signal series is the honest representation of "there is no radio here", and the
//  state gauge means a dashboard can still distinguish "wired" from "telemetry
//  off". This is what lets a reader say "the link was fine, the regression is
//  ours" (or vice-versa) instead of guessing.
//
//  SECRET-FREE: RSSI/rate/noise are radio physics; SSID/channel/band are the
//  user's OWN network identity on their OWN machine, carried only in the local
//  opt-in diagnostics (same trust boundary as the rest of the rig - local,
//  single-user, ephemeral). No host credentials, keys, or pairing material.
