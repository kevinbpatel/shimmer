//  FramePacer+TickDeficit.swift
//
//  The tick-deficit DEGRADED MODE - the failsafe for the macOS frame-rate
//  governor throttling CADisplayLink callbacks below the pinned
//  preferredFrameRateRange floor (the floor is ADVISORY; on battery + the
//  built-in ProMotion panel it is demonstrably ignored). All four hard stalls
//  of one battery wifi run were this mechanism: ticks collapsed
//  120→10-58/s while frames kept arriving at 110-120fps with the radio provably
//  clean (zero net gaps >100ms all session, RSSI/txRate flat through every
//  freeze), so the tick-slaved pacer froze the screen and machine-gunned the
//  depth-6 queue into drops_presentation_late at up to 110/s.
//
//  The failsafe keys on the ACTUAL fault, MEASURED - never inferred: a rolling
//  ~250ms window over the pacer's own tick/release counters yields the realized
//  tick rate, compared against min(stream Hz, NOMINAL panel Hz). When ticks sag
//  below half of that for a full window with frames queued, an off-tick release
//  timer on the pacing queue takes over releasing due frames at stream cadence
//  (in-session proof this is the right shape: one collapse's giveup ran a
//  direct-present phase at renders==received, 0 late drops, o2p median 2.63ms
//  vs 9-13ms paced). It also re-commits the current frame when nothing new
//  flows, so the governor never classifies the layer as static - the suspected
//  spiral that locks a collapse in (commits stop → governor holds the low
//  rate). The mode disengages on its own the moment measured ticks recover
//  (hysteresis: enter <0.5×, exit ≥0.8× expected) - dynamic, condition-keyed,
//  self-recovering, never a one-way latch.
//
//  JITTERY-LINK SAFETY (the watchdog's regression history is the cautionary
//  tale): the trigger is a pure DISPLAY-side signal - realized CADisplayLink
//  callback rate - which network jitter cannot move. Zero-loss wifi jitter
//  pins the FIFO and late-drops while ticks stay at panel rate (~120/s ≥ 0.8×
//  expected), so the mode can never engage on a jittery-but-ticking link. The
//  expected rate is clamped to the NOMINAL panel Hz (which keeps reading the
//  rated cadence even while callbacks are throttled - verified
//  refresh_changed=0 through every collapse), so fps>refresh setups (120fps on
//  a 60Hz panel, ticks legitimately half the stream rate) and the wired 240Hz
//  panel's 119.996Hz divisor-decimation seconds (~0.71× expected) never read
//  as a deficit. Suppressed presentation (window hidden → link stops BY
//  DESIGN) is excluded explicitly.
//
//  This file also owns the WARM HANDOVER for pacer re-enable (the cold cutover
//  onto an un-primed link re-froze the stream 350ms after a measured re-enable)
//  and the floor-violation breadcrumb (direct, postmortem-visible evidence of
//  the governor overriding the pinned floor).
//
//  Two companions carry the rest of the mechanism, split off so each unit stays
//  under the file-length budget: FramePacer+TickDeficitEvents.swift holds the
//  `TickDeficitEvent` vocabulary the locked service pass below returns plus the
//  OFF-LOCK breadcrumb logging, and FramePacer+DeficitTimer.swift the off-tick
//  release timer (reconcile / synthetic-vsync beat / governor repaint).
