//
//  IOReportSampler.swift
//
//  Opt-in P1 RESOURCE sampler #2 (system-level): SoC P-cluster vs E-cluster
//  ACTIVE RESIDENCY via Apple's IOReport "CPU Stats / CPU Complex Performance
//  States" channels, plus (bring-up #2) SoC PACKAGE POWER via "Energy Model"
//  and GPU ACTIVE RESIDENCY via "GPU Stats". The cluster half is the SYSTEM
//  side of the "are we using P vs E cores right?" question - the per-process
//  per-thread half lives in ResourceTelemetry. The power/GPU half closes the
//  one resource question neither could answer: is a heavy session GPU-bound or
//  thermal-budget-bound?
//
//  WHY IOReport (and the deliberate scope): IOReport is the same private-but-
//  stable C API `powermetrics`/asitop/macmon read. We dlopen it at RUNTIME
//  (/usr/lib/libIOReport.dylib resolves from the dyld shared cache) so there is
//  NO link-time framework dependency and NO change to the Xcode project - a
//  client-side-only addition.
//
//  SECOND BRING-UP (power + GPU), what attempt #1 missed: both groups needed a
//  different DECODE, not a different subscription. "Energy Model" channels are
//  SIMPLE-format integer accumulators - IOReportStateGetCount returns -1 for
//  them, so the state-residency parse read nothing; they decode via
//  IOReportSimpleGetIntegerValue plus the per-channel unit label ("CPU Energy"
//  is mJ while "GPU Energy" is nJ on the SAME SoC). And the GPU "GPUPH" state
//  channel matches neither the `E` nor `P` cluster-name prefix and idles in a
//  bucket named "OFF", so the CPU-cluster fold skipped it. With those decode
//  fixes the same minimal dlopen/subscription path reads both groups cleanly.
//  Package power = the "CPU Energy" + "GPU Energy" + ANE rails - the sum
//  powermetrics reports as "Combined Power (CPU + GPU + ANE)"; deliberately
//  NOT the DRAM/display/PCIe rails, so it tracks the compute work we cause.
//  Each group rides its OWN subscription, so a failure of either new read
//  degrades to nil without touching the proven cluster-residency path.
//
//  GATING + HOT-PATH SAFETY (load-bearing - see TelemetryExporter.swift):
//    * Constructed ONLY on the gate-on path (the exporter builds it in start()).
//      When telemetry is off (default) NOTHING here is constructed: no dlopen, no
//      subscription, no sample - zero overhead, exactly like WiFiTelemetry.
//    * Sampled ONLY on the exporter's serial workQueue at ~1Hz - NEVER a hot
//      path. There is no per-frame and no per-packet cost. Each IOReport delta
//      between two ~1s-apart samples is one cheap framework call.
//    * Any dlopen/symbol/subscription failure degrades to "no sample" (nil) so a
//      bring-up hiccup can never affect the stream - but NEVER silently: every
//      failing stage now leaves a one-time Diag NOTICE (see below). Without
//      these breadcrumbs the fields can ship DARK (zero rows, zero clues) even
//      when bring-up succeeds in a different environment - the many silent nil
//      paths mean a packaged app could be dead-on-arrival invisibly.
//
//  FIX-OR-REMOVE DECISION (made on a packaged run's evidence - do not
//  pre-empt it in code):
//    * If a stage fails on a packaged build, the stage-naming NOTICEs below
//      name it. If the dlopen/subscription is flat-out refused: remove this
//      sampler honestly - delete the file, its exporter hook
//      (TelemetryExporter+CaptureSections.fillResource), the NDJSON/prom
//      render keys, and gate the dashboard power/GPU panels off.
//    * If API-stage (a group/format change on a newer OS): fix the decode or
//      drop only the failing group - each group already degrades independently.
//    * What is NOT acceptable is the prior state: fields documented as shipped
//      yet absent from every row with no way to know why.
//
//  PROCESS-LIFETIME, NEVER DEALLOCATED (2026-08-30 crash fix): the sampler is
//  a keep-alive singleton. Releasing what IOReport hands back is not
//  survivable in practice: the shipped 2026.8.15 crashed in objc_release
//  inside the compiler-generated IOReportSampler.deinit (a dict -> array ->
//  dict dealloc chain over freed memory) when a telemetry session's teardown
//  released the duplicated-channels dictionaries and final retained samples
//  alongside the subscriptions. The API's real ownership does not follow the
//  CF Create/Get rules its names suggest (the memory-discipline note below
//  records an earlier over-release found the same way), and every long-lived
//  IOReport consumer - powermetrics, asitop, macmon - holds its subscription
//  for the life of the process and never frees anything. So: construct once
//  on the first gate-on session via `shared`, reset the delta baselines per
//  session (`beginSession()`), keep the dlopen handle + subscriptions until
//  process exit. The cost of the keep-alive is a few KB of dormant CF state
//  after the first opted-in session; the alternative was a teardown crash.
//
//  SECRET-FREE: residency fractions and package watts are pure SoC physics. No
//  host identity, keys, pairing material, or secrets.
