//
//  StreamSession+Reconnect.swift
//
//  Silent reconnect-as-stall. When the host closes a LIVE session with a
//  recoverable code - Sunshine's process restarting across a Windows lock /
//  secure-desktop transition (it returns in ~3s), or a brief network blip -
//  we DON'T bounce to the launcher and DON'T sit through the watchdog's 10s
//  freeze-then-teardown. Instead we hold the frozen last frame on screen and
//  silently re-establish the connection underneath it, resuming in place when
//  video flows again (matching Moonlight's "hang then resume"). Only on
//  give-up (attempts/window exhausted) do we tear down for real.
//
//  This is possible because the frozen frame survives a connection teardown:
//  backend.stopConnection() runs the decoder's sink stop()/cleanup() (which
//  only invalidate the VideoToolbox session + param sets), but NOT
//  VideoDecoder.teardown() or StreamWindow.close() - so the
//  AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer keeps its last image until a fresh setup() +
//  IDR repaints over it. We keep the window, decoder, input forwarder, the
//  retained bridge, StreamBridgeContext.current, and the event stream alive
//  across the rebuild; only the backend connection + NetworkClient are
//  replaced.
