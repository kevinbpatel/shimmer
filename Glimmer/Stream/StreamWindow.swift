//
//  StreamWindow.swift
//
//  Fullscreen NSWindow hosting the AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer that
//  VideoDecoder enqueues decoded sample buffers into. Owned by StreamSession.
//  Captures the cursor while frontmost, releases it when the user invokes
//  the quit hotkey.
//
//  Why AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer and not CAMetalLayer
//  ---------------------------------------------------
//  We tried - three times - to get correct HDR out of a CAMetalLayer driven
//  by a custom MSL fragment shader doing BT.2020 NCL YUV→RGB + range
//  scaling. On the a 4K@240 HDR1000 panel, every variant landed somewhere
//  on the same wrong axis: overbright midtones, washed highlights, milky
//  blacks. moonlight-qt on the same display, host, and content shows inky
//  blacks and proper bright highlights.
//
//  The reason: on macOS, moonlight-qt's HDR-correct path is not
//  `vt_metal.mm` (its Metal-shader fallback). The default macOS path is
//  `vt_avsamplelayer.mm`, which sidesteps Metal entirely. It hands the OS a
//  CVPixelBuffer wrapped in a CMSampleBuffer and lets AVFoundation +
//  CoreAnimation do colorspace conversion, PQ EOTF application, and EDR
//  tone-mapping against the display's actual peak luminance. There is no
//  shader. There is no manual CSC. The OS owns the pipeline end-to-end.
//
//  When you write PQ-encoded BT.2020 codes into a CAMetalLayer with a
//  custom shader, even with all the right metadata (itur_2100_PQ
//  colorspace, EDRMetadata, wantsExtendedDynamicRangeContent), the
//  compositor still has to reverse-engineer what the shader did. The
//  AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer path skips that round trip: the
//  CVPixelBuffer carries primaries / transfer / matrix attachments,
//  the CMFormatDescription carries mastering-display + content-light
//  metadata, and the layer's colorspace tells the compositor exactly
//  how to interpret the bits. No guesswork, no shader-vs-OS fight.
//
//  This is the same architectural choice moonlight-qt made on macOS and
//  the reason their HDR output is correct on the same panel.
//
//  Why we don't use `NSWindow.toggleFullScreen(_:)`:
//
//    `toggleFullScreen` puts the window in macOS's *Space-based* fullscreen
//    mode. That mode is owned by the OS, which means:
//      • Cursor-to-top reveals the menu bar.
//      • Esc / ⌘Esc can yank the user out of the stream.
//      • Cmd-Tab into the app surfaces the menu bar and Dock.
//    None of that is acceptable for a game-streaming client where Esc is a
//    game input and the user genuinely wants the host to own the screen.
//
//  What we do instead - same approach SDL's `SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP`
//  takes on macOS, which moonlight-qt selects on this platform:
//
//    • Borderless window sized to the target NSScreen's full frame.
//    • Window level kept at `.normal` (same as SDL FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP).
//      `CGShieldingWindowLevel()` looks attractive - chrome can't paint
//      above it - but it's the screen-lock / screensaver level, and
//      AppKit lets a window become first responder at that level while
//      silently dropping `sendEvent:` key delivery, so hotkeys (quit,
//      stats) stop firing in-stream. The
//      `presentationOptions = [.autoHideMenuBar, .autoHideDock]` gate is
//      what hides the chrome, NOT the window level.
//    • `collectionBehavior` includes `.canJoinAllSpaces` so the window stays
//      visible across Space switches, and explicitly does NOT include
//      `.fullScreenPrimary` (we're not using Space-based fullscreen).
//    • `NSApplication.presentationOptions` is set to auto-hide the menu bar
//      and Dock while the stream is up, then restored on close.
