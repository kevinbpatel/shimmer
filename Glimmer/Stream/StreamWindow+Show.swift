        //    visible during the C-handshake gap. Hiding them at show()
        //    time exposed the bare desktop (no menu bar, no
        //    Dock) for several hundred ms while the stream connected,
        //    which read as a letterbox flash. The choice of options
        //    themselves is unchanged; only the timing moved.
        //
        //    The candidates and why we picked what we picked:
        //
        //      .hideMenuBar           - totally hides the menu bar. Combined
        //                               with .hideDock this is the most
        //                               aggressive option. Downside: AppKit
        //                               can be funny about restoring state
        //                               cleanly if the app crashes mid-stream.
        //      .autoHideMenuBar       - menu bar slides away but reveals on
        //                               cursor-to-top. While the stream is up
        //                               the window is sized to the full
        //                               screen at `.normal` level; AppKit
        //                               does not surface the menu bar over a
        //                               frontmost window in this mode, so
        //                               the reveal-on-top behaviour does not
        //                               actually paint anything on the user.
        //                               This is what we use.
        //      .disableProcessSwitching - blocks Cmd-Tab from switching out.
        //                               We deliberately DON'T set this:
        //                               we want the user to be able to
        //                               Cmd-Tab away if they need to (e.g.
        //                               an urgent message). Cmd-Tab away
        //                               drops us behind the new active app,
        //                               which is the correct UX.
        //
        //    .autoHideDock is paired with .autoHideMenuBar because AppKit
        //    requires them to be set together (setting .autoHideMenuBar
        //    without auto-hiding the Dock raises NSInvalidArgumentException).
        //
        //    UPDATE: switched from .autoHideMenuBar → .hideMenuBar so the
        //    window actually owns the full panel area on notched MacBooks.
        //    `.autoHideMenuBar` keeps the 37pt menu-bar zone reserved (the
        //    bar slides in on cursor-to-top), which means our fullscreen
        //    frame is screen.frame.height = 1890 on a 14" MBP instead of
        //    the panel's true 1964. The bitstream we receive is 1964 tall;
        //    resizeAspect then letterboxes left/right ~57px. `.hideMenuBar`
        //    actually hides the bar entirely and lets the window cover the
        //    full physical panel including the notch zone - matching what
        //    SDL FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP gives moonlight-qt. There's no
        //    in-stream menu-bar-reveal in this mode, which we don't want
        //    during gaming anyway (the cursor is hidden + associate-false while
        //    relative aim is engaged).
        //    The safe-area opt-out is the `coversNotch` toggle below.
        // Sync the delegate's notch-coverage flag with the public toggle
        // so AppKit's willUseFullScreenContentSize: returns the right
        // size when the user clicks Stream. The presentation-options
        // application is deferred to `fadeInOnFirstFrame()` (see above).
        streamDelegate.coversNotch = coversNotch

        // 3. Bring the *app* to the foreground before we ask the *window* to
        //    become key. macOS will refuse key status to any window of a non-
        //    active app, which is exactly the trap we hit when the stream is
        //    launched from a SwiftUI button: the click activates the host
        //    window briefly, our borderless KeyableWindow comes up, and
        //    without an explicit activate the new window is "on screen but
        //    not key" - mouseMoved fires (it's hover, not focus), but
        //    keyDown does not.
        NSApp.activate()

        // 4. Cover the screen. We size to the current NSScreen.main frame so
        //    if the user dragged the main Glimmer window onto a non-primary
        //    display before clicking Stream, we cover *that* display rather
        //    than always landing on the system primary.

        //     cosmetic pre-position before relative aim engages. This runs
        //     BEFORE the relative-delta pipeline and the associate-false latch
        //     are live (enterCapturedMode fires later via installFirstResponder
        //     / the becomeKey observer), so it cannot inject a motion delta to
        //     the host. Its only job is to place the (about-to-be-hidden,
        //     about-to-be-disassociated) cursor somewhere sane. The Y-convention
        //     is handled by the shared `StreamCursor.warpToCentre` helper (CGWarp
        //     wants Quartz top-left, not AppKit bottom-left; the helper also
        //     handles the non-primary/scaled-screen flip correctly).
        if let screen {
            StreamCursor.warpToCentre(of: screen)
        }

        // `CGAssociateMouseAndMouseCursorPosition(false)` - is done by
        // InputForwarder.enterCapturedMode() once the window is key, NOT here.
        // This is the SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode(true) recipe: the OS stops moving
        // the (already-hidden, see setCursorHidden below) cursor so it can never
        // reach a hot corner, and relative HID deltas are read off the CGEvent's
        // kCGMouseEventDeltaX/Y. The prior associate-false attempt failed only
        // because it was paired with NSEvent.deltaX/Y (which goes silent) and no
        // hide; both are fixed now. See the file-top notes in
        // InputForwarder+Capture.swift for the full contract.

        // 5. Two fullscreen paths, picked by `coversNotch`. This mirrors
        //    moonlight-qt's session.cpp:588 logic for handling notched
        //    MacBook displays, which in turn maps to SDL's
        //    `SDL_HINT_VIDEO_MAC_FULLSCREEN_SPACES` hint:
        //
        //    A) coversNotch == true  → SDL_HINT...=0  → borderless covering
        //       window at .mainMenu level + 1 (above the menu bar). NO
        //       Space-based fullscreen. The window owns the entire physical
        //       panel including the notch zone; the layer paints up to the
        //       physical notch cutout. HDR engages because we're the
        //       topmost layer-host on the display. moonlight-qt routes
        //       here when the user picks the full-native resolution.
        //
        //    B) coversNotch == false → SDL_HINT...=1  → Space-based
        //       fullscreen via toggleFullScreen. AppKit handles the Space
        //       creation and reserves the menu-bar / notch area as safe
        //       inset, so content lays out below the notch. Used when the
        //       user explicitly wants the safe-area framing.
        //
        //    Earlier the codebase hardcoded path B because we believed
        //    HDR engagement required Space-based fullscreen - that's only
        //    half-right. Borderless at .mainMenu level + the right
        //    presentation options also engages HDR (which is what
        //    moonlight-qt has been doing all along).
        // Start invisible - we fade in on the first decoded frame so the
        // user never sees the borderless covering window mid-handshake
        // (an empty AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer renders black and reads
