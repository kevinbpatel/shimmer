//  The PROMETHEUS render for the P1 AUDIO metric family (the other stream):
//  receive-quality, output-buffer health, A/V clock drift, and the cold-start
//  first-packet time. Split from TelemetryExporter+Render.swift - pure move,
//  same file-split idiom as the FramePacer split - to keep that file under the
