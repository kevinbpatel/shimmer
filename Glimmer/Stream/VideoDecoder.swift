//  VideoDecoder.swift
//
//  VideoToolbox + AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer video pipeline for Glimmer.
//
//  This file owns the `VideoDecoder` class core: lifecycle, VT session,
//  packet enqueue, and layer attachment. The HDR pipeline (MDCV/CLL parsing,
//  PQ colorspace setup, EDR engagement, first-frame probe) lives in
//  `VideoDecoder+HDR.swift`. Bitstream parsing (H.264/HEVC/AV1 NAL walking,
//  parameter-set assembly, AVCC conversion, sample buffer construction)
//  lives in `VideoDecoder+Bitstream.swift`. The per-frame stats counters
//  (`StatsCollector`) live in `StatsCollector.swift`.
//
//  Architecture overview
//  ---------------------
//  The native backend hands us Annex-B elementary stream data (H.264 / HEVC /
//  AV1) on its internal receive threads via the decoder-renderer sink. We
//  parse the bitstream into a CMSampleBuffer,
//  push it through a VTDecompressionSession (HW accelerated when the
//  capability check passes), and enqueue the resulting CVPixelBuffer onto an
//  AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer for the OS to render.
//
//  Why no Metal shader / why AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer
//  ----------------------------------------------------
//  This file used to drive a CAMetalLayer through a custom MSL fragment
//  shader doing BT.2020 NCL YUV→RGB, range scaling, chroma cositing, and
//  PQ-tagged output for HDR. Three rounds of tuning later, HDR was still
//  visibly wrong on a 4K240 HDR panel: overbright midtones, washed highlights,
//  milky blacks vs. moonlight-qt on the same host/display/content showing
//  inky blacks and full peak luminance.
//
//  The cause was architectural, not a CSC math bug. moonlight-qt's
//  HDR-correct macOS path is `vt_avsamplelayer.mm`, not `vt_metal.mm`. The
//  latter is a Metal-shader fallback (used on Linux/Windows variants of
//  their stack); the former is what runs on real macOS clients. It uses
//  AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer, which:
//
//    * Takes a CMSampleBuffer wrapping the CVPixelBuffer that VT produces.
//    * Reads the pixel buffer's `kCVImageBufferColorPrimariesKey`,
//      `kCVImageBufferTransferFunctionKey`, `kCVImageBufferYCbCrMatrixKey`
//      and `kCVImageBufferMasteringDisplayColorVolumeKey` /
//      `kCVImageBufferContentLightLevelInfoKey` attachments to know what
//      the pixels mean.
//    * Reads the CMFormatDescription's extensions for HDR metadata when
//      the pixel buffer doesn't carry it.
//    * Reads `layer.colorspace` (kCGColorSpaceITUR_2100_PQ for HDR) to know
//      how to interpret the bits at composite time.
//    * Does YUV→RGB conversion, PQ EOTF, and EDR tone-mapping in the OS's
//      own display pipeline against the panel's actual peak luminance.
//
//  There is no shader. There is no manual CSC matrix. The OS owns the
//  pipeline end-to-end, and that's the only way to get color-correct HDR
//  on macOS without re-implementing the entire macOS HDR compositor in
//  Metal - which Apple specifically does NOT want us to do, see
//  "Using Color Spaces to Display HDR Content" in the Metal docs:
//  > "Don't perform tone mapping in your shader. AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer
//  >  applies tone mapping based on the current EDR headroom."
//
//  What this file does now
//  -----------------------
//   1. Decode H.264 / HEVC / AV1 bitstreams with VTDecompressionSession.
//   2. For tagged streams: VT already attaches the right
//      primaries/transfer/matrix to the produced CVPixelBuffer.
//   3. For untagged streams (some Sunshine builds ship video without VUI
//      colour info): we attach the right CGColorSpace based on what we
//      know from the stream config (HDR mode + 10-bit → BT.2020/PQ;
//      otherwise BT.709).
//   4. When the host signals HDR via LiSetHdrMode, we pull mastering-display
//      + content-light metadata via LiGetHdrMetadata and attach it as
//      CMFormatDescription extensions (MDCV / CLL), in the exact GBR-order
//      big-endian byte layout HDR10 uses - matching moonlight-qt's
//      vt_base.mm::setHdrMode byte-for-byte.
//   5. Wrap the CVPixelBuffer + CMFormatDescription in a CMSampleBuffer
//      and enqueue it on the AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer.
//   6. Handle the layer's `AVQueuedSampleBufferRenderingStatusFailed` state
//      by flushing and rebuilding the format description - without this,
//      macOS 14+ silently stops rendering after the first decode error.
//
//  Threading model
//  ---------------
//   * setup/start/stop/cleanup/submitDecodeUnit fire on the native backend's
//     receive threads. We never block them.
//   * Bitstream → CMSampleBuffer happens inline in submitDecodeUnit.
//   * The VTDecompressionSession outputs on the decode dispatch queue.
//     That callback builds the CMSampleBuffer and enqueues it directly on
//     the AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer - no display-link, no mailbox, no
//     render queue. AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer owns the v-sync pacing.
//   * Display-layer mutations (colorspace, wantsEDR, flush) happen on the
//     main actor.
