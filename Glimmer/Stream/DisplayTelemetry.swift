//  DisplayTelemetry.swift
//
//  Opt-in PRESENT/DISPLAY-side sampler for the telemetry rig (P1). Answers the
//  "is the panel actually in HDR, and is it ramping?" question that the decode
//  side can't: the live EDR headroom (NSScreen.maximumEDR) over time, whether HDR
//  is engaged end-to-end, which screen the stream composites on, and the panel's
//  ProMotion (variable-refresh) capability. EDR + HDR + screen are all main-actor
//  probes (NSScreen / AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer), so they CANNOT be read on the
//  exporter's background queue the way the Wi-Fi sampler is.
//
//  GATING + HOT-PATH SAFETY (load-bearing - see TelemetryExporter.swift):
//    * The MAIN-actor sampler timer is constructed ONLY on the gate-on path (the
//      exporter builds it in `start()` after the gate check). When telemetry is
//      off (default) nothing here is constructed, scheduled, or read: zero cost.
//    * The sampler fires at ~1Hz on the MAIN run loop (NOT a hot path - the decode
//      queue, the pacer's serial queue, and the receive thread are all untouched).
//      Each tick is a handful of cheap NSScreen / layer property reads.
//    * The accumulator is lock-guarded so the background exporter queue can read a
//      tear-free snapshot at its own 1Hz cadence. The lock is on the telemetry
//      path only (the sampler that writes it doesn't exist when off).
//
//  SECRET-FREE: EDR headroom is a float; HDR-engaged + ProMotion are bools; the
//  screen name is the user's OWN display label on their OWN machine (same local
//  trust boundary as the Wi-Fi SSID label). No host identity, keys, or secrets.
