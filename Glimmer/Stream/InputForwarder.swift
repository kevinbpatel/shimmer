//
//  InputForwarder.swift
//
//  Forwards keyboard, mouse, and gamepad input from the local Mac to the
//  remote host via the native backend's input-uplink methods (the LiSend*
//  family the GameStream protocol defines). Hosts the user's configurable
//  in-stream quit hotkey.
//
//  Implementation notes - read before editing:
//
//   * Input goes through a custom NSView (`StreamInputView`) installed as the
//     window's contentView's responder. Earlier revisions used
//     `NSEvent.addLocalMonitorForEvents`, but on macOS 26 the responder chain
//     consumes mouseMoved/keyDown events for content views that accept first
//     responder *before* the local monitor block fires. Routing through
//     NSResponder overrides is the only thing that's reliably ordered.
//
//   * The native backend's input queue is gated on the input stream being
//     started, which happens only after the control stream's RTSP handshake
//     completes. Any send call made before that returns -2 and does NOT
//     enqueue. We expose `setReady(_:)` so StreamSession can flip the gate
//     when the `connectionStarted` listener callback fires; until then we
//     drop events on the floor instead of generating a flood of -2 log lines.
//
//   * Keyboard codes are sent as positional scancodes via
//     `LiSendKeyboardEvent2(Int16(bitPattern: 0x8000 | UInt16(bitPattern: vk)), ...)`. The high bit asks the host to
//     skip its layout-correction pass (GFE tries to "fix" AZERTY → QWERTY by
//     remapping VK_*; we want the position to win because the user is looking
//     at their physical keyboard). This is the same convention moonlight-qt
//     uses in its Mac build.
//
//   * NKRO: every physical key-down or key-up emits one and only one
//     `LiSendKeyboardEvent2` - there is NO "single key in flight" state, no
//     per-event modifier reset, no "release before press" coalescing. macOS
//     delivers each physical-key transition as its own NSEvent (AppKit does
//     not collapse simultaneous presses), and the responder chain hands each
//     to `keyDown(with:)`/`keyUp(with:)` independently. With four fingers on
//     four keys we send four down events; lifting any one sends exactly one
//     up event for that key. `raiseAllHeldInputs()` (keys + buttons +
//     modifiers) fires only on focus loss and `detach()` (stream teardown),
//     so state never resets mid-game while the window stays key.
//     `lastModFlags` is diffed against the new mask in `flagsChanged` so we
//     only emit modifier transitions, not modifier state on every key. This
//     matches moonlight-qt's `m_KeysDown` QSet semantics.
//
//   * Mouse motion is *relative* via the SDL associate-false model
//     (P0 mouse-snap fix). When relative aim is engaged we call
//     `CGAssociateMouseAndMouseCursorPosition(false)` (enterCapturedMode) so the
//     OS STOPS physically moving the on-screen cursor - exactly
//     SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode(true) on macOS. This is the airtight fix for the
//     in-game aim snapping to a screen edge/corner: the prior model kept the
//     cursor associated and warped it back to centre near an edge, but an
//     associate-TRUE warp posts a reconciling mouse-moved event carrying the
//     full edge→centre delta (~1500px), which (with no suppression anywhere) was
//     read as pure HID motion and sent to the host. Under associate-false the
//     cursor never moves, so there is no edge, no warp, and no reconciliation
//     delta to leak - the bug class is structurally gone. Ownership:
//       1. Visibility: owned ENTIRELY by StreamWindow, which hides the cursor
//          with `CGDisplayHideCursor` (single source of truth =
//          `StreamWindow.didHideCursor`). CGDisplayHideCursor (unlike
//          NSCursor.hide) does not require the cursor to be over our window, so
//          the hide can't no-op. With the cursor hidden there is no visible
//          pointer to "freeze" - the two reasons associate-false was previously
//          abandoned (visible freeze + dead deltas) both no longer apply.
//       2. Relative deltas: read off the CGEvent backing each mouseMoved
//          NSEvent via `CGEventGetIntegerValueField(_, kCGMouseEventDeltaX/Y)`.
//          These raw, accel-free HID deltas stay valid AND become pure HID under
//          associate-false (the exact field SDL reads in relative mode). Only
//          NSEvent.deltaX/Y goes silent under associate-false - and we don't use
//          it. The previous Glimmer revision read NSEvent.deltaX/Y and wrongly
//          concluded associate-false killed deltas; the right field is the
//          CGEvent layer underneath.
//       3. Association: every associate-false (enterCapturedMode) is paired with
//          a guaranteed associate-true (exitCapturedMode, run on resign-key and
//          detach) so Cmd-Tab / teardown restores a normal OS-controlled pointer.
//          Hot corners are a non-issue: the OS doesn't move the cursor, so it
//          can never reach a corner - warpCursorIfNearEdge was deleted.
//     This is the SDL relative-mouse recipe on macOS: hide (CGDisplayHideCursor)
//     + associate-false + read kCGMouseEventDeltaX/Y.
//     A local NSEvent monitor for the gesture family
//     (`.magnify`/`.smartMagnify`/`.swipe`/`.rotate`) swallows the high-
//     level gesture events while the stream window is key so a trackpad
//     pinch can't reach macOS's window scaler. The narrower mask is
//     intentional: a broader set (`.gesture`/`.beginGesture`/`.endGesture`/
//     `.pressure`) swallows raw trackpad pan/scroll data on laptops with
//     no external mouse, killing cursor + scroll because the OS
//     synthesises mouseMoved from the same gesture stream we're eating.
//     (Ctrl+scroll Accessibility Zoom is the one trigger the freeze used to
//     gate that a monitor cannot - its non-freezing replacement is the
//     kCGAnnotatedSessionEventTap escalation, not yet installed; see
//     InputForwarder+Capture.swift.)
//
//   * Diagnostic event tap: while a stream is live (isReady == true) we
//     install two NSEvent monitors (local + global) that log every input
//     event AppKit delivers to the process at .info level. Reproducing the
//     mid-game macOS-zoom bug once and grepping for "DiagEvent"
//     in the log shows exactly which event type fires immediately
//     before the zoom - that drives whether we need to escalate to a
//     CGEventTap (see TODO(eventtap) in installDiagnosticMonitors). Rate-
//     limited to ~100 events/sec via a 1-second windowed sampler.
//
//   * macOS Accessibility Zoom keyboard shortcuts (⌥⌘8, ⌥⌘=, ⌥⌘-) are
//     intercepted unconditionally in streamView(_:handleKeyDown:) - we
//     return `true` so StreamInputView.keyDown skips its `super.keyDown`
//     path (which doesn't get called in any code path; see the comment
//     in StreamInputView.keyDown below) and the OS never sees the chord.
//     These are pure-OS chords with no game meaning; the intercept is
//     orthogonal to `captureSysKeys`.
//
//   * Gamepad arrival is announced via `LiSendControllerArrivalEvent`. Some
//     host versions register a controller slot only after seeing this; without
//     it `LiSendMultiControllerEvent` events appear to be silently dropped on
//     newer Sunshine builds.
