//
//  StreamSession+Start.swift
//
//  The session start path: pair/verify → launch/resume → build the backend
//  config → stand up the window/decoder/input subsystems → publish the event
//  stream + bridge → start the connection → arm the watchdogs/timers. Split out
//  of StreamSession.swift to keep that file under the length limit; see that
//  file for the actor's stored state and the callback lifetime contract.
//
//  The phase-by-phase setup blocks that don't touch the start() defers (log the
//  config, stand up the subsystems on the main actor, wire the per-subsystem
//  backends) are pure-moved into private helpers below so the orchestrating
//  start() stays readable; behavior is identical to the prior inline form. The
//  bodies of the two defers are helpers for the same reason - the defers
//  themselves stay in start(), so the single cleanup site is unchanged. The
//  backend-config build + the connect leg (both shared with the reconnect
//  driver) live in StreamSession+Connect.swift.
