//
//  Identity.swift
//
//  Client-side identity for the streaming engine: a stable unique ID plus an
//  RSA-2048 keypair under a self-signed X.509 certificate (CN = "NVIDIA
//  GameStream Client", 20-year validity). These three pieces of state are what
//  the host uses to recognize us - both during the pairing handshake and on
//  every subsequent TLS connection. They're generated once on first launch and
//  persisted to mode-0600 files under ~/Library/Application Support/Glimmer/
//  Identity/ so a process running as our UID can re-load them silently across
//  rebuilds without any Security.framework prompt.
//
//  Ported (loosely now) from moonlight-qt's app/backend/identitymanager.{h,cpp}.
//
//
// STORAGE DECISION: mode-0600 files under Application Support, deliberately.
// We evaluated moving to the keychain once builds went Developer-ID signed,
// and chose to stay on files:
//
//   * The data-protection keychain (the clean per-app store) is gated behind a
//     `keychain-access-groups` entitlement, which on a Developer-ID Mac app
//     (no provisioning profile) makes AMFI refuse to LAUNCH the process
//     (RBSRequestErrorDomain Code=5 / POSIX 163). It needs an embedded
//     provisioning profile to work at all - not worth that machinery here.
//
//   * The login keychain works without a profile, and a stable Developer-ID
//     signature fixes the adhoc CDHash-ACL re-prompt that drove us off it
//     before - but it only buys encryption-at-rest for a narrow gain on a LAN
//     streaming identity, and the project already tried it once and retreated.
//
//   * The reference (moonlight-qt) stores PLAINTEXT PEM in a mode-0644
//     QSettings plist under ~/Library/Preferences - no keychain at all. Our
//     mode-0600 files are already stricter: 0600 keeps every other user out
//     (0600 > 0644).
//
// So: files. See SECURITY.md for the user-facing version.
//
//
// THREAT MODEL:
//
// The long-lived RSA-2048 private key authenticates Glimmer to every paired
// host indefinitely. If it leaks, the attacker is a permanent imposter against
// every host this install paired with - until the user unpairs each one.
//
// The mode-0600 files keep every other user on the Mac out. Unsandboxed, there's
// no container boundary, so a same-UID process isn't blocked by macOS - the 0600
// perms are the boundary (still stricter than moonlight-qt's 0644 plist). A
// TCC-allowlisted app with Full Disk Access can still read them - an OS-level
// boundary, not a Glimmer-specific defence.
