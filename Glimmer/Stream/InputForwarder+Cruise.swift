//  InputForwarder+Cruise.swift
//
//  "Cruise": a velocity-gated, resolution-derived traversal boost for relative
//  mouse motion. Glimmer forwards raw HID deltas and linearizes the Mac's
//  pointer accel (raw-aim, default-on), which removed the acceleration that used
//  to let a fast flick cover the whole screen - so at 4K the cursor feels slow to
//  traverse. Cruise restores fast-traversal coverage WITHOUT touching aim: it
//  applies a gain >1 ONLY to fast movements, derived purely from the stream
//  resolution. Below the knee the gain is exactly 1.0 (the sacred aim band, byte-
//  identical to today). Same save→read discipline as MouseAccelerationControl.
//
//  Runs AFTER the Mac linearization - it is the only client-side gain, so there
//  is no double-accel. No wire/host/protocol change: still relative LiSendMouseMove.
