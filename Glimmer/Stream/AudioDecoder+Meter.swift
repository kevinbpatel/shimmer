//  AudioDecoder+Meter.swift
//
//  The P1 AUDIO playout meter + cushion machinery: the meter's tunables, the
//  schedule-side trim-toward-target / over-run gates and drift re-baseline, the
//  completion-side playhead + under-run edge (with its rate-limited
//  route-carrying NOTICE) + adaptive cushion grow/decay, the published
//  audio-state gauge, and the playout-stall watchdog's detection half. Split
//  from AudioDecoder.swift - same idiom as the FramePacer split, to
//  keep that file under the length limit. The stored meter state stays on
//  the class (stored properties can't live in extensions); see the property
//  docs there for the locking + design rationale.
//
//  Its two siblings, split off for the same length reason: the decode-path
//  pre-roll arbiter + re-prime silence backfill in AudioDecoder+Prime.swift, and
//  the default-output-route sampler the breadcrumbs read in
//  AudioDecoder+Route.swift.
