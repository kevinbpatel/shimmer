//  TelemetryLatency.swift
//
//  Per-stage video latency breakdown for the opt-in telemetry rig. Captures, per
//  frame, the monotonic timestamps at the four pipeline stages and turns them
//  into (a) Prometheus-style HISTOGRAMS (so the exporter emits queryable
//  p50/p95/p99 per stage via `histogram_quantile`) and (b) a PER-FRAME NDJSON
//  trace written batched OFF the hot path. See TelemetryExporter.swift for the
//  gate/safety contract; this file is the latency half of that rig.
//
//  STAGES (all captured with a cheap monotonic read - `DispatchTime.now()` wraps
//  mach_absolute_time):
//    * t_receive  - last packet of the frame arrived (RtpVideoQueue → the
//                   depacketizer's `firstPacketReceiveTimeUs`, already captured).
//    * t_assemble - depacketizer completed the access unit (reassembleFrame, the
//                   DecodeUnit's `enqueueTimeUs`, already captured).
//    * t_submit   - handed to VTDecompressionSessionDecodeFrame (VideoDecoder).
//    * t_output   - VT output callback produced a CVPixelBuffer (VideoDecoder).
//    * t_present  - renderer.enqueue (FramePacer → VideoDecoder.presentFrame).
//  Deltas: receive→assemble, assemble→submit, submit→output (decode),
//  output→present (pacing), and end-to-end receive→present.
//
//  HOT-PATH SAFETY + GATING (load-bearing - zero-overhead when OFF):
//    * `FrameTimingTracker.shared` is nil unless the gate is on. Every stage call
//      site is `if let tracker = FrameTimingTracker.shared { ... }`, so when OFF the
//      cost is a single nil-optional load - NO allocation, NO lock, NO map.
//    * When ON, ONE bounded map (keyed by the frame's rtpTimestamp, which is the
//      only frame identity that survives the VideoToolbox boundary - frameNumber
//      is lost once the sample's PTS is all VT propagates to its output callback)
//      tracks in-flight frames. It is guarded by ONE os_unfair_lock - a new lock,
//      but NOT a hot-path lock on the proven decode/pace path: the existing
//      StatsCollector / FramePacer / depacketizer locks are untouched, and this
//      lock is only taken on the (already off-by-default) telemetry path.
//    * The map is bounded: stale entries (a dropped / never-presented frame) are
//      evicted in FIFO insertion order so a leak is impossible.
//    * The histograms are fixed-bucket atomic counters - a stage record is a
//      branchless bucket find + one locked add. No per-frame allocation.
//    * The per-frame NDJSON record is appended to an in-memory buffer and flushed
//      by a ~250ms background timer - NEVER an fsync (or even a write) on the hot
//      path.
//
//  SECRET-FREE: every value here is a nanosecond delta or a frame index. Nothing
//  that could carry a secret, key, or host identity.
//
//  This file owns the PER-FRAME TRACKER (the bounded in-flight map, the stage
//  records, and the trace feed). The fixed-bucket histograms it folds into are a
//  pure move into TelemetryLatencyHistograms.swift, and the per-tick snapshot
//  value type into TelemetryLatencySnapshot.swift, so each unit stays under the
//  file-length budget.
