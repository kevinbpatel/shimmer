//
//  AudioDecoder+Engine.swift
//
//  The opus + AVAudioEngine LIFECYCLE: `initDecoderCore` (decoder create,
//  channel layout, graph wiring, engine start, session state reset), the
//  `shutdown()` teardown, and the mid-stream RECOVERY family that keeps playout
//  alive - the H3/H4 configuration-change hop, the bounded engine-restart retry
//  ladder, the exception-safe prime-edge start, and the playout-stall rebuild.
//  Split from AudioDecoder.swift - same idiom as the FramePacer split, to keep
//  that file under the length limit. They belong together: every one of them is
//  an AV-node call serialized on `stateLock`, and they share the same "no AV
//  calls from a completion handler" discipline.
//
//  Split cost (the ControllerForwarder.swift note, applied here): stored
//  properties cannot live in an extension, so the opus/engine core state stays
//  on `AudioDecoder` and is `internal` rather than `private` for the methods in
//  this file (and AudioDecoder+Decode.swift) to reach. See the property docs in
//  AudioDecoder.swift for the locking rationale each one carries.
