//  StatsOverlayLayer.swift
//
//  The in-stream stats overlay compositor: a CALayer stack that renders the
//  StreamStatsSnapshot rows (icon + attributed text + health color + dividers)
//  over the AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer, plus the OneShotObserverBox helper.
//  Split out of StreamWindow.swift to keep each unit focused.
//
//  This file owns the panel: its stored layers, the per-tick row diff, the
//  visibility transition, and the layout pass. The ROW CONSTRUCTION it calls
//  into (sublayer build, attributed-string composition, health colors, SF
//  Symbol rasterisation) is a pure move into StatsOverlayLayer+Rows.swift, so
//  each unit stays under the file-length budget.

// MARK: - StatsOverlayLayer

/// Compact-HUD stats panel rendered above the AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer.
///
/// Hierarchy:
///   displayLayer (AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer, view's root)
///     └─ StatsOverlayLayer container (CALayer) - rounded translucent panel
///        ├─ row 0: icon (CALayer.contents = SF Symbol CGImage)
///        │         + text (CATextLayer with NSAttributedString -
///        │           SF Pro Text label on the left, SF Mono value on
///        │           the right with health color)
///        ├─ row 1: same shape
///        ├─ divider (1pt CALayer at 8% white) - only between sections
///        ├─ row 2 ...
///        └─ row N
///
/// Why a row-per-sublayer-pair architecture and not one big newlined
/// CATextLayer:
///   * Per-row icons require their own CALayer.contents anyway - once
///     we have a sublayer per row to host the icon, packing the text
///     into the same row's text sublayer keeps the icon and its row's
///     baseline aligned naturally (one CATextLayer line height, one
///     icon, one frame).
///   * Per-row health colors are easier to express as
///     NSAttributedString attributes on a single-row text layer than
///     on a multi-line block (CATextLayer respects per-range
///     foregroundColor only via NSAttributedString, so the multi-line
///     path also pays the attributed-string cost).
///   * Diffing rows is cheaper: when only the value of one row changes
///     (the common case), we update one CATextLayer.string and skip
///     the rest. Newline-joined CATextLayer.string requires re-rendering
///     the whole block on any line change.
///
/// Sizing: a fixed 360pt panel width with the height growing to fit the
/// current number of rows + dividers. The panel never shrinks below
/// `padding * 2 + rowHeight` so a zero-rows state still renders a small
/// visible chip (rather than collapsing to a glyph-less rectangle, which
/// would surprise a user who toggled all checkboxes off in Custom).
