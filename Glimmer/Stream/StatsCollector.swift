//
//  StatsCollector.swift
//
//  Thread-safe counters for the in-stream stats overlay. Owned by
//  `VideoDecoder` for the lifetime of one streaming session.
//
//  Touched from three thread contexts during normal operation:
//    * The native backend's receive thread, via `recordReceivedFrame` - once
//      per submitDecodeUnit, before VT touches anything.
//    * VT decode dispatch queue, via `recordDecodeSubmit` /
//      `recordDecodeComplete` / `recordDecodeAbandoned` /
//      `recordRendererEnqueue`. Submit and complete fire in lock-step on the
//      same queue (we serialize decode on a single queue with ThreadCount=1),
//      so the submit-time FIFO doesn't need an external lock for ordering -
//      just for the cross-thread snapshot read.
//    * The FramePacer's dedicated serial queue, via `recordPacingDepth` (once
//      per display vsync, 60-240 Hz) / `recordPresent` (once per released
//      frame) / `recordPresentationLateDrop` (on overflow + trim). The same
//      lock serializes these against the snapshot read.
//    * Main actor, via `snapshot(minWindowSeconds:)` / `reset()` - at 4 Hz
//      from the overlay timer. The FPS averaging window is DECOUPLED from that
//      tick: `snapshot(minWindowSeconds:)` only slides + recomputes the
//      window-relative fields once `minWindowSeconds` (~1s) of data has
//      accumulated, serving the cached last-good average on the in-between
//      ticks (see the cache block + the window-complete gate in snapshot()).
//      A literal 500ms window was too tight at 60Hz - single-frame boundary
//      effects pushed the displayed FPS by ±2fps; the ~1s window smooths to
//      ±1fps on a steady stream while the live latency gauges still refresh
//      every 4 Hz tick. The telemetry exporter calls it with the default
//      `minWindowSeconds == 0`, preserving the original reset-every-read
//      window on its own cadence.
//
//  All shared mutable state is protected by a single os_unfair_lock. The hot
//  paths only hold it for a handful of integer/double updates per frame -
//  well under a microsecond - which at 240 FPS is nowhere near a contention
//  risk and orders of magnitude under any frame-pacing budget. Using a lock
//  rather than atomics here is the right tradeoff: the decode-time EMA and
//  submit FIFO need consistent multi-field updates, and a single lock is
//  simpler than juggling several `OSAtomic*` calls.
