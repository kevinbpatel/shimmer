//  StatsCollector+Record.swift
//
//  The hot-path recording API + lightweight accessors for StatsCollector - the
//  per-frame `record*` mutators called from the native backend's receive
//  thread, the VideoToolbox decode queue, and the FramePacer's pacing queue,
//  plus the `secondsSince*` / `*Count` reads the watchdog + telemetry use. Split
//  out of StatsCollector.swift (which keeps the stored state, `reset()`, and the
//  windowed `snapshot()`) so each unit stays under the file-length budget. All
//  methods take the same single `os_unfair_lock` declared on the class; the
//  cross-file extension is intra-module so it shares that internal state.
