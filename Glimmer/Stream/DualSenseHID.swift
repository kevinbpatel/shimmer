//  DualSenseHID.swift
//
//  Raw-HID side-channel for the Sony DualSense, read over IOKit's
//  IOHIDManager - exactly how moonlight-qt / SDL's HIDAPI driver does it.
//  macOS's GameController framework does NOT deliver the DualSense's centre
//  buttons (Options ≡, Create/Share, Mute) to apps, so a controller-only exit
//  chord and full button parity are impossible through GCController alone.
//  This reads the raw input report alongside GameController (non-exclusive
//  open - it never seizes the device, so GCController keeps everything it
//  already provides: sticks, face, shoulders, triggers, touchpad, battery).
//
//  Surfaces the centre buttons GameController drops (plus the two shoulder bits
//  the quit-chord predicate reads from the same byte). Everything else stays
//  on the GameController path.
//
//  REQUIRES the "Input Monitoring" privacy permission (TCC kTCCServiceListenEvent
//  - it covers game controllers, not just keyboards). Raw-HID open works under
//  the unsandboxed Developer-ID build with no device.* entitlement. NOT
//  Mac-App-Store-compatible (raw device HID is a hard App-Review reject).
//  MAS-STRIP: a future Mac App Store target must remove this file and the call
//  sites that reference DualSenseHID (ControllerForwarder / InputForwarder /
//  TroubleshootingPane).
