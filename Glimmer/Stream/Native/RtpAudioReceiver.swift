//
//  RtpAudioReceiver.swift
//
//  Owns the audio UDP flow for the Swift-native backend: ONE UNCONNECTED POSIX
//  UDP socket (bind a wildcard ephemeral local port; NEVER connect()) used for
//  BOTH the periodic ping (sendto host:audioPort) and RTP receive (recvfrom from
//  ANY source). The host sources audio RTP from a port != audioPort and aims it
//  at the ping's UDP source port, so a *connected* NWConnection would silently
//  drop audio - exactly the bug VideoRtpReceiver was built to avoid. This MIRRORS
//  VideoRtpReceiver's socket/ping pattern. Source: AudioStream.c
//  (AudioReceiveThreadProc + AudioPingThreadProc) + RtpAudioQueue.c.
//
//  Transport ported from moonlight-common-c (GPLv3); see CREDITS.md.
//
//  PING (AudioStream.c:38-65): send a 20-byte SS_PING
//  { payload[16] + sequenceNumber (UInt32 BE) } - the fast-start burst first,
//  then the CONDITIONAL steady cadence (EnvSignalController.steadyPingInterval
//  - 75ms Wi-Fi-doze keepalive / 500ms relaxed; upstream pings a flat
//  500ms) - payload =
//  the 16 raw bytes from the SETUP-audio X-SS-Ping-Payload header. seq starts
//  at 1, incremented BEFORE each send. If no payload captured (legacy GFE), send the 4-byte "PING"
//  { 0x50,0x49,0x4E,0x47 }. The host won't reply to RTSP PLAY (GFE 3.22) and
//  won't aim audio at us until it has received a ping - so ping + receive MUST
//  share one socket.
//
//  RECEIVE (AudioStream.c:239-383): drop runt packets (< 12 bytes); byteswap
//  the RTP header BE→host; feed the queue; dispatch the queue result to the
//  decoder. Where the C drops a fixed first-500ms of audio (GFE buffers samples
//  before the client is ready), we run a backlog-aware startup gate instead -
//  Sunshine paces audio live from seq ~0, so the fixed drop cost half a second
//  of LIVE audio per session (see the gate state docs below). For our SDP
//  (encEnabled=0) audio is PLAINTEXT - no AES-CBC decrypt. (Encryption support
//  is deferred; see the host constraints.)
//
//  Teardown is bounded: recvfrom blocks with a 100ms SO_RCVTIMEO so the loop
//  polls `interrupted` and exits within 100ms; stop() also close()s the fd, which
//  unblocks any in-flight recvfrom immediately. The ping Task is cancellable.
