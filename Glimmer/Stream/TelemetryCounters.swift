/// the engine (IDR/RFI requests, backlog overflow, present stalls, frame loss,
/// unrecoverable frames, pacer give-up) plus the receive-path packet/FEC totals.
/// All `OSAllocatedUnfairLock`-free: each counter is its own atomic so an
/// increment is a single locked add with no cross-counter contention. These are
/// ALWAYS live (not gated) because the increments are unconditional integer adds
