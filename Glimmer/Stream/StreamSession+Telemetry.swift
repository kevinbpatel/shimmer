//  StreamSession+Telemetry.swift
//
//  Wires the opt-in `TelemetryExporter` onto a live session. Split out of
//  StreamSession.swift so the gating + reader-closure construction lives in one
//  focused unit; see TelemetryExporter.swift for the exporter itself and the
//  gate/safety contract.
//
//  GATING: the exporter is built ONLY when the opt-in gate is on (default OFF),
//  so a normal session allocates NOTHING here and there is no per-tick cost. The
//  reader closures are `@Sendable` and capture the live backend + decoder so the
//  exporter's own background queue never reaches into actor-isolated state.
//
