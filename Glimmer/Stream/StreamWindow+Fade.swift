//  StreamWindow+Fade.swift
//
//  The stream window's two OPACITY TRANSITIONS and the teardown the
//  fade-out completes: the first-frame fade-in, the menu-bar/Dock
//  presentation-options handoff that is deliberately deferred until the
//  window is opaque (the "bare-desktop flash"), and close() with its final
//  post-fade teardown. Split out of StreamWindow.swift (pure move) to keep
//  each unit under the length limit; see that file for the window's stored
//  state and the AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer rationale, and
//  StreamWindow+Show.swift for the bring-up this pairs with.
//
//  Both fades honor Reduce Motion by snapping instead of ramping - a
//  large-surface opacity animation is exactly what that setting asks us to
//  drop - and both keep the presentation-options change on the OPAQUE side
//  of the transition. MainActor throughout (AppKit).
