    // SDL ASSOCIATE-FALSE CURSOR MODEL (P0 mouse-snap fix). This is
    // the SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode(true) recipe on macOS and is the airtight
    // root-cause fix for the in-game aim snapping to a screen edge/corner.
    //
    // Visibility is owned ENTIRELY by StreamWindow (hide via CGDisplayHideCursor,
    // single source of truth = StreamWindow.didHideCursor). The input layer here
    // owns relative-aim engagement (now including the associate-false latch),
    // gesture suppression, and never touches cursor VISIBILITY (that's
    // StreamWindow's).
    //
    // Why associate-false (and why the prior warp-to-centre model was the bug):
    //   * The previous "reconciled" model kept the cursor ASSOCIATED (the OS
    //     keeps physically moving it) and warped it back to centre when it
    //     neared a screen edge. An associate-TRUE warp posts a reconciling
    //     mouse-moved event whose kCGMouseEventDeltaX/Y carries the FULL
    //     edge→centre jump (up to ~1500px on a 3024-wide panel). There was NO
    //     post-warp suppression anywhere, so that reconciliation delta was read
    //     as pure HID motion and sent to the host → the in-game aim snapped to
    //     an edge/corner. Intermittent because it only leaked when a warp's
    //     reconciliation event landed in the motion pipeline.
    //   * Under associate-false the OS STOPS moving the on-screen cursor. There
    //     is therefore no edge to warp from, no warp at all, and no
    //     reconciliation delta to suppress - the entire bug CLASS is structurally
    //     gone. This is exactly what moonlight-qt/SDL do (SDL_cocoamouse).
    //   * The two reasons the prior associate-false attempt was abandoned no
    //     longer apply: (a) "the cursor freezes visibly" - it's hidden by
    //     CGDisplayHideCursor, so there is no visible pointer to freeze; the
    //     user only ever sees in-game aim driven by relative deltas. (b) "the OS
    //     stops reporting deltas" - that was true of NSEvent.deltaX/Y, but we
    //     read kCGMouseEventDeltaX/Y off the CGEvent layer (mouseDelta(from:)),
    //     which stays valid AND becomes pure accel-free HID under associate-false
    //     (the exact field SDL reads in relative mode).
    //   * Every associate-FALSE is paired with a guaranteed associate-TRUE on
    //     resign-key / teardown so Cmd-Tab and stream-end always restore a
    //     normal, OS-controlled pointer.
    //
    // Gesture suppression (unchanged, still needed under associate-false):
    //   * Trackpad gesture family (pinch/.magnify, smart-zoom/.smartMagnify,
    //     three-finger-swipe/.swipe, .rotate): the NSEvent local monitor below
    //     consumes them for our key stream window. Sufficient on its own -
    //     these dispatch through AppKit, so returning nil stops the default
    //     zoom/swipe handlers.
    //   * macOS Accessibility "Smart Zoom" keyboard chords (⌥⌘8/=/-): swallowed
    //     in streamView(_:handleKeyDown:) (InputForwarder+StreamView.swift).
    //   * Hot corners (Mission Control etc.): under associate-false the OS does
    //     not move the cursor, so it can never reach a corner - the warp's old
    //     job is gone entirely (warpCursorIfNearEdge deleted).
    //   * Ctrl+scroll Accessibility Zoom: this is interlocked at the
    //     WindowServer/SkyLight layer BELOW NSEvent dispatch, so neither the
    //     monitor above nor the chord swallow can cancel it. With the cursor
    //     associate-false the scroll still reaches us as a relative event; the
    //     documented non-freezing replacement remains the kCGAnnotatedSession-
    //     EventTap escalation scoped in the diagnostic-tap comment below (a
    //     session-scoped CGEventTap consuming control+scrollWheel for our PID,
    //     needs Accessibility permission). Not installed yet - gated behind the
    //     diagnostic.

    // This monitor logs every event AppKit delivers to our process during
    // a streaming session at .info level so the user can reproduce the
    // zoom once, paste the log slice, and we'll see exactly what fired in
    // the milliseconds before the zoom appeared.
