//
//  InputForwarder+Lifecycle.swift
//
//  Session lifecycle for the input path: installing the `StreamInputView` into
//  the stream window, promoting it to first responder once the window is
//  actually key, tearing the whole thing down, and flipping the ready gate the
//  native backend's `connectionStarted` callback drives. Split from
//  InputForwarder.swift - same idiom as the ControllerForwarder split, to keep
//  that file under the length limit; the per-event forwarding (keys, modifiers,
//  mouse capture) stays there and in InputForwarder+Capture/+StreamView.swift.
//
//  Split cost (the ControllerForwarder.swift note, applied here): stored
//  properties can't live in an extension, so the state these four touch stays on
//  `InputForwarder` and relies on default `internal` access - including
//  `isReady`, whose setter widened from `private(set)` to `internal(set)`
//  because `detach()` and `setReady(_:)` write it from this file.
//
