//
//  StreamSession.swift
//
//  Top-level orchestrator for a streaming session. Holds one native-backend
//  connection lifetime, owns the decoder/audio/input/window subsystems, and
//  emits a stream of `StreamEvent` values to the UI.
//
//  Threading model:
//   - Public API is actor-isolated.
//   - Backend callbacks fire on the native backend's receive threads. We
//     marshal each one back into the actor via Task { await self.handle... }.
//   - Video frame submission stays off the actor for latency reasons -
//     VideoDecoder owns its own internal queue.
//
//  Callback bridging - read this before adding callbacks:
//   The native backend calls back into us on its RTP/control receive threads.
//   Rather than maintain three independent "active X" globals - one per
//   subsystem - we route every callback through a single `StreamBridgeContext`
//   instance:
//     * `Unmanaged.passRetained(bridge).toOpaque()` produces the opaque pointer
//       retained for the connection lifetime, so context-aware callbacks
//       dereference it directly.
//     * `StreamBridgeContext.current` is a weak static set on init / cleared
//       on dealloc so context-less callbacks can find the bridge.
//     * The bridge holds *weak* references to the session and each subsystem.
//       If a subsystem is torn down, the weak ref nils out and the callback
//       no-ops - no UAF, no order dependency.
//   The bridge is released in `stop()` only after the backend has stopped
//   (which drains the receive threads), making it impossible for a backend
//   thread to dereference a freed Swift object.
