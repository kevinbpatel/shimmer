//
//  TelemetryExporter.swift
//
//  Opt-in, zero-overhead-when-off performance telemetry for the native streaming
//  engine. The point of this rig is to diagnose + tune the pipeline: when enabled
//  it exposes the full picture - fps triple, decode-time percentiles, present
//  cadence, recv-jitter, FEC recovery, ENet reliable-stream health, pacing depth,
//  drops-by-cause, input rate, CPU/threads, plus monotonic event counters and a
//  sampled latency breakdown - at a 1Hz cadence, with a connect-relative timestamp
//  + session id so the INITIAL-CONNECTION phase is fully visible.
//
//  GATING (default OFF). Enabled by EITHER:
//    * UserDefaults bool `telemetryEnabled` == true, OR
//    * environment GLIMMER_TELEMETRY=1.
//  When OFF, `TelemetryExporter.makeIfEnabled` returns nil and NOTHING is
//  allocated/started - no listener, no timer, no file, and the snapshot provider
//  is never invoked, so there is no per-frame and no per-tick cost. The
//  per-event counters (`TelemetryCounters`) are unconditional integer adds at
//  already-rare event sites (an IDR request, a lost frame), well under a
//  microsecond and orders of magnitude below any pacing budget - they cost
//  nothing measurable whether or not the exporter is running.
//
//  SAFETY (load-bearing):
//    * The HTTP endpoint binds LOOPBACK by default (and only ever when telemetry
//      is opt-in ENABLED - default OFF ⇒ no listener at all). The LAN bind
//      (0.0.0.0, IPv4) needs the SECOND opt-in defaults key `telemetryListenLAN`:
//      it lets a LOCAL monitoring container/pod (one scraping over a host bridge,
//      where traffic never arrives on loopback) reach `/metrics`, at the cost of
//      exposing live perf/input-rate telemetry to any LAN host.
//      No auth is added (auth on a debug-gated metrics port is its own attack
//      surface, and the data carries no secrets).
//    * Telemetry contains ONLY performance numbers. NEVER secrets, keys, tokens,
//      pairing material, or host credentials. The session id is a random opaque
//      tag, not a host identifier.
//    * A busy port is tolerated: we log + skip the listener (the NDJSON sink
//      still runs), and never crash the stream.
//
//  TWO SINKS, ONE SNAPSHOT:
//    1. A tiny HTTP server (Network.framework `NWListener`, port 9847) serving
//       `GET /metrics` in Prometheus text exposition format.
//    2. One NDJSON line per ~1s appended to
//       ~/Library/Logs/Glimmer/telemetry-<ISO8601>.ndjson (dir created).
//  Both render the SAME `TelemetrySnapshot`, captured once per second on a
//  dedicated serial queue - the StatsCollector read reuses its existing lock
//  (no second hot-path lock is added).
