//  GameController framework integration: wireless discovery, slot allocation,
//  arrival announcements, the GCController → moonlight type/flag derivation, and
//  the install/heal of the per-frame value-changed handlers.
//
//  Originally inline in InputForwarder.swift; split out so the C-bridge core
//  (mouse/keyboard capture lifecycle) and the gamepad path live in separate
//  files. Stored state (`attachedControllers`, `gamepadMask`,
//  `connectObserver`, `disconnectObserver`) lives on `InputForwarder` proper
//  so the extension has somewhere to put per-instance bookkeeping. Methods
//  in this file rely on default `internal` access to those stored properties.
//
//  Split further by topic, for the same length reason: the per-frame state push
//  those handlers run (and the button bitmask it builds) in
//  ControllerForwarder+StatePush.swift, the touchpad surface → host touch events
//  in ControllerForwarder+Touchpad.swift, the quit chord + its hold-to-quit
//  dwell in ControllerForwarder+QuitChord.swift.
