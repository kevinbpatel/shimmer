    /// captured pair handshake is offline-brute-forceable in ~10ms at 4
    /// digits, ~640ms at 6 digits. The protocol-level mitigation is the
    /// follow-on RSA signature: an attacker who recovers the PIN-derived
    /// key still cannot impersonate the host without the host's RSA
    /// private key. So PIN entropy is NOT the only authentication signal.
