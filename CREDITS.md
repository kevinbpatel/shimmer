# Credits

Glimmer's Swift streaming transport was **ported from
[moonlight-common-c](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-common-c)**,
the core protocol library written by the
[Moonlight Game Streaming](https://github.com/moonlight-stream) team. Their
implementation of the GameStream/Sunshine wire protocol is hard-won work, and
Glimmer would not exist without it. Thank you.

A few higher-level pieces, the pairing handshake, the nvhttp control client, and
the frame pacer, were likewise ported from the same team's
[moonlight-qt](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt) (also GPLv3).

These are faithful ports, so Glimmer is a derivative work and is distributed
under the **GNU General Public License v3** (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)), the same
license as the originals. The GPLv3 notice on the ported files is accurate and
intentional.

## MIT-licensed upstreams ported via moonlight-common-c

Two of the components ported into the Swift engine originate from separately
licensed (MIT) projects that moonlight-common-c vendors. Their copyright and
permission notices are preserved here, as the MIT license requires:

- **[enet](https://github.com/lsalzman/enet)** - Copyright (c) 2002-2024 Lee
  Salzman. MIT License. `Glimmer/Stream/Native/EnetControlChannel*.swift` and
  `EnetWire.swift` port the protocol logic of the enet sources vendored in
  moonlight-common-c (`protocol.h` / `host.c` / `protocol.c`).
- **[nanors](https://github.com/sleepybishop/nanors)** - Copyright (c) 2021
  Joseph Calderon. MIT License. `Glimmer/Stream/Native/ReedSolomon.swift` ports
  `nanors/rs.c` plus the scalar GF(256) math from nanors' vendored
  `deps/obl/oblas_lite.c` (covered by the same nanors license).
