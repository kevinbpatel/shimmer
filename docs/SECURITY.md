# Security

## Reporting

**Security contact: GitHub Security Advisories.** Use the repository's
**Security → Report a vulnerability** flow (private vulnerability reporting) -
it is end-to-end private between you and the maintainer, needs no key exchange,
and is the channel that is actually monitored. Include a description of the
issue, reproduction steps, and the affected version (`Glimmer.app` → menu bar →
About, or
`defaults read /Applications/Glimmer.app/Contents/Info CFBundleShortVersionString`).

Public disclosure on GitHub Issues is acceptable for non-exploitable bugs (UI
glitches, build failures, etc.). Anything involving the client identity, the
pairing handshake, host-cert pinning, the stream-transport parsers, the
privileged AWDL helper, or the Hardened Runtime posture should go through a
private advisory first.

## Threat model

Glimmer is a home-LAN game-streaming client. The audience is a user streaming
from their own gaming PC to their own Mac on their own network. The threat model
is sized to that.

**In scope:**

- **Same-LAN passive observer** - packet sniffer on the LAN. The control channel
  runs mutual TLS post-pairing; the video / audio / input streams are
  AES-128-GCM encrypted end-to-end under `EncryptionPreference.all`, which is
  the default (see `Glimmer/Stream/Types.swift`).
- **Same-LAN active MITM** - an attacker who can intercept or redirect traffic
  between the Mac and the host. Defended by RSA-validated pairing handshake +
  post-pairing cert pinning (see Pairing + Pinning sections below). Pre-pairing
  first contact is HTTP, which is acceptable because there's nothing to MITM yet
  - the pin is established by an out-of-band PIN the user types into the host's
    UI, which is what authenticates the cert we then pin.
- **Same-UID malware on the Mac** - partially defended. Glimmer is unsandboxed
  (see Runtime hardening below for why), so the identity and pinned-cert files
  live in the home directory at mode 0600 / parent dir 0700 rather than inside a
  sandbox container. Another app under the same UID cannot read them by default
  POSIX permissions, but the container boundary is gone; a TCC-allowlisted
  attacker with Full Disk Access still wins, as it did before - that's an
  OS-level boundary, not a Glimmer-specific defence.
- **Hostile host** - a host that has somehow been compromised cannot escalate
  beyond producing bad video / audio / input echoes. The pinned-cert pairing
  limits a hostile host to one the user has explicitly trusted out-of-band.
- **Untrusted stream input - the in-tree Swift transport parsers.** The
  streaming engine is pure Swift (`Glimmer/Stream/Native/`): RTSP/SDP response
  parsing, the ENet-subset control channel, RTP video/audio depacketization,
  Reed-Solomon FEC reassembly, and AES-GCM decrypt all parse bytes that arrive
  over UDP/TCP from the network. Memory-safety bugs, parser confusion, and
  malformed-packet crashes in these parsers are **in scope and ours** - report
  them here, not upstream.

**Out of scope:**

- Nation-state attackers.
- Supply-chain compromise of the build toolchain (homebrew `openssl@3`, Xcode).
- Kernel-level attackers / a hostile macOS install.
- Local attacker with root. Nothing to defend; they already have everything.
- Protocol-design limitations fixed by GameStream / Sunshine (e.g. the 4-digit
  PIN, plain-HTTP pre-pairing rounds) - we implement the protocol's defenses
  faithfully but cannot change the wire contract. Bugs in
  [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine) itself belong upstream.

## Identity

Per-machine RSA-2048 client identity, generated on first launch, 20-year
self-signed cert with CN `NVIDIA GameStream Client` (the standard GameStream
client identifier).

**Storage: mode-0600 files**, not the keychain. Three files:

- `client-cert.pem` - X.509 cert in PEM
- `client-key.pem` - RSA private key in PEM (PKCS#8 unencrypted)
- `client-uniqueid.txt` - 32-hex-char client unique ID

Stored at `~/Library/Application Support/Glimmer/Identity/`.

`FileIdentityStore.write` (`Identity.swift`):

- Atomic write via `Data.write(options: [.atomic])` so a crash mid-write cannot
  leave a torn PEM on disk.
- `setAttributes([.posixPermissions: 0o600])` then `stat`-verify the permission
  bits stuck. Some FUSE / NFS backends silently ignore `chmod`; if the
  verification fails, the partial file is deleted and the call throws.
  Half-written secrets on a too-permissive filesystem are worse than no file at
  all.
- Parent directory created at mode 0700.

**Why files, not the keychain (a deliberate call).** We evaluated moving to the
keychain once builds became Developer ID signed, and stayed on files:

- The **data-protection keychain** (the clean per-app store) needs a
  `keychain-access-groups` entitlement, which on a Developer ID Mac app with no
  embedded provisioning profile makes the OS refuse to launch the process (AMFI
  / "Launchd job spawn failed"). It would require shipping a provisioning
  profile - machinery not worth it here.
- The **login keychain** works without a profile and, now that signing is stable
  (Developer ID), no longer hits the per-rebuild ACL prompt that drove us off it
  before - but it only adds encryption-at-rest for a narrow gain on a LAN
  streaming identity, and the project already tried it once and retreated.
- The reference implementation (**moonlight-qt**) stores the same RSA key as
  **plaintext PEM in a mode-0644 QSettings plist** under
  `~/Library/Preferences`, no keychain at all. Glimmer's mode-0600 home files
  are already stricter: only the owning UID can read them, and 0600 beats 0644.

The one residual exposure is a Full-Disk-Access same-UID process reading the
key. That is a narrow OS-level threat, and one the reference implementation
doesn't address either.

**One-shot moonlight-qt migration.** On first launch, Glimmer reads the
`com.moonlight-stream.Moonlight` preference domain. If a moonlight-qt install
left a client identity and a paired-host list there, we adopt both so the user
doesn't have to re-pair. The copy is one-way and read-only: Glimmer never writes
to the foreign plist, so moonlight-qt keeps its own identity and its own
pairings. Moonlight's storage is not 0600 and Glimmer cannot change that on its
behalf; what Glimmer controls is its own copy, which lands in the mode-0600 file
store described above. Idempotent, version-gated, and dormant after the first
run. See `Identity+Loading.swift` and `HostsStore.swift`.

## Pairing

The GameStream PIN handshake. Protocol-fixed by GameStream / Sunshine; we don't
get to pick the primitives. Five HTTP rounds plus a final HTTPS liveness check
(`Glimmer/Stream/Pairing.swift`).

**Primitives:**

- AES-128-ECB on raw 16-byte buffers, no padding (the protocol pre-sizes
  everything to 16-byte multiples).
- Key derivation: `SHA-256(salt || PIN)[0..16]` for Gen 7+ (modern GFE and all
  Sunshine). SHA-1 for pre-Gen-7 GFE; sniffed from `appversion`. We don't expect
  to encounter SHA-1 on Sunshine.
- RSA-2048 signatures using the long-lived client cert / host cert for the MITM
  check and the PIN-correctness check.

**PIN entropy.** 4 digits, generated client-side via
`AppModel.generatePairingPIN()` and shown to the user to type into the host. ~13
bits. Brute-force isn't a worry: the host controls the retry rate and a wrong
PIN aborts the handshake mid-round (the host returns a hash that doesn't match
the one our PIN would have produced - see step 4 in `runPairingFlow`).

**Pin commit timing.** The host cert is pinned AFTER:

1. The host's RSA signature over its pairing-secret block verifies against the
   cert it sent us in step 1 - proves the host holds the private key matching
   the cert.
2. The PIN-correctness hash check passes - proves the host knew the PIN the user
   typed out-of-band.

Only then does `NetworkClient.setPinnedHostCert` get called. This is **not**
trust-on-first-use: `NetworkClient.fetchServerInfo` will NOT auto-pin on first
contact. The previous "auto-pin on first /serverinfo" behaviour was the
canonical same-LAN-attacker-rides-an-induced-TLS-error gap; closed in the same
refactor that moved the pin into the pairing flow (search for `SECURITY (C2)` in
`NetworkClient+Endpoints.swift`).

**Failure path.** Any deviation throws `StreamError.pairingFailed` with a
specific message at `.private` log privacy. The caller sees a uniform "pairing
failed" - the specific cause (wrong PIN, MITM detected, host mid-pair with
someone else) is recoverable from logs under our subsystem, not from the UI. We
send `/unpair` after a failure to clear the host's "Already pairing" state for
retry.

## Pinning

Host certs are pinned **after** successful pairing. The pin lives in a mode-0600
file at `~/Library/Application Support/Glimmer/PinnedHosts/<hostID>.pem`, where
`hostID` is the host's UUID (or its hostname, when that is all we have) with
anything outside `[A-Za-z0-9-_.]` replaced by `_`. `PinnedCertStore`
(`Types+Cert.swift`) owns it, at parent-directory mode 0700.

The pins moved out of `UserDefaults` because `cfprefsd` is shared across
same-UID processes: any other process running as the user could rewrite a pin
through the preferences daemon. They are stored as PEM rather than a raw
`SecCertificate`, because PEM survives keychain wipes, OS migrations, and Time
Machine restores in a way the `SecCertificate` ref does not. The cert is public
information; the threat mode-0600 addresses is _write_, not _read_.

**Once pinned, ANY mismatch fails the connection.** Enforcement lives in
`ControlTransport.swift`: `performBlocking` runs a post-handshake exact-DER pin
check via `X509_cmp` (no `URLSession`, no `SecTrust`), refusing the connection
if the leaf cert doesn't byte-equal the pinned PEM. We do NOT silently re-pin on
TLS error. The previous auto-rebind-on-TLS-error path was the gap a same-LAN
attacker rode to pin their own cert - closed.

**Rotation UX.** A real cert rotation (Sunshine reinstall, OS reset on the host)
throws `StreamError.hostUnreachable("pinned host cert mismatch")` out of
`ControlTransport`. `HostStatusPoller` turns that specific error into a
`certMismatch` host state, and the launcher's readiness chip goes amber and
reads **Trust needed** with the description "Host certificate changed, re-pair
to trust it". Clicking the chip opens the pairing sheet, pre-filled with the
host's address.

There is no "accept the new certificate" button anywhere. Re-pairing is the only
path, which means the user has to read a fresh PIN off the host's own UI to
replace the pin. The friction is the point: an on-path attacker who can rotate
the cert cannot also produce the PIN.

## Transport

- **Pre-pairing:** plain HTTP on **47989** for `/serverinfo` and the five
  pairing rounds. There's no TLS to validate yet; the out-of-band PIN
  authenticates the cert we then pin.
- **Post-pairing:** HTTPS on **47984** for `/serverinfo`, `/launch`, `/cancel`,
  `/applist`, and the final pairing-flow `/pair?phrase=pairchallenge` liveness
  check. Mutual TLS - our client identity authenticates us to the host, the
  pinned host cert authenticates the host to us. The system trust store is NOT
  consulted; the pinned PEM is the entire trust anchor.
- **Stream:** the Swift-native engine's RTP video/audio + ENet-subset control
  channels (`Glimmer/Stream/Native/`). AES-128-GCM, key derived from the launch
  response's `rikey` (or `gcmkey` on Sunshine). `EncryptionPreference.all` is
  the default - encrypts video, audio, and input. `.audioOnly` encrypts audio +
  input but leaves video plaintext (saves bandwidth on slower CPUs at the cost
  of clear-text frame data on the wire); `.none` is exposed for diagnostics, not
  recommended.

## Runtime hardening

**Glimmer runs UNSANDBOXED.** This is a deliberate trade, not an oversight.

**Why no sandbox.** The Wi-Fi-stutter helper registers a root LaunchDaemon via
`SMAppService.daemon`, and a sandboxed app cannot install or run a system
daemon - the helper needs root to run `ifconfig awdl0 down`. The Mac App Store
path was already closed independently: the root `SMAppService` daemon cannot be
shipped sandboxed at all, and a sandboxed build would also need
`com.apple.security.device.usb` (DualSense raw-HID adaptive triggers / haptics),
a hard MAS reject. There was no sandboxed-and-shippable configuration to give
up.

**Compensating controls that remain:**

- **Hardened Runtime** (`ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME = YES`): no JIT, library
  validation, no library injection. Xcode emits a note that the runtime is
  disabled under adhoc signing - expected for development; the setting persists
  so Developer ID signed Release builds get the full enforcement.
- **Developer-ID signing + notarization + stapling.** Release builds are signed
  with the team Developer ID, notarized by Apple, and the ticket is stapled to
  the app and DMG.
- **Minimal-attack-surface helper.** The root daemon's XPC protocol is four
  methods (`helper/Protocol.swift`), and exactly one of them changes anything:
  `setAWDLDown(_:reason:)`. The other three (`currentStatus`, `ping`,
  `reSuppressCount`) are read-only. It is not a run-anything-as-root backdoor.
  It accepts a connection only from a caller whose code signature satisfies the
  designated requirement in `helper/HelperService.swift`:
  `identifier "io.ugfugl.Glimmer" and anchor apple generic and certificate leaf[subject.OU] = "5T7M4RH3F8"`
  - the signed Glimmer app, not a process that merely claims the bundle id.

**The defense-in-depth the sandbox used to provide** was containment of a
memory-safety exploit in the streaming-protocol parsers reachable from a
malicious host. With the sandbox gone, that is addressed by hardening the
parsers directly instead:

- **Fuzz the host-reachable parsers** - a deterministic swift-testing suite
  (`GlimmerTests/FuzzTests.swift`) hammers Annex-B / RTP / FEC / RTSP / ENet /
  AES-GCM with random + mutated-valid input, asserting they reject rather than
  trap. It found and fixed an out-of-bounds read in the Reed-Solomon FEC
  decoders (a shard shorter than the block size).
- **Hardened Runtime library validation is ON for Release.** The embedded
  OpenSSL/Opus dylibs are re-signed under the team id at build time, so the
  Release entitlements drop `disable-library-validation`. Adhoc / Debug builds
  link the Homebrew dylibs as-is and keep it via `Glimmer-Debug.entitlements` -
  an adhoc binary has no team id for validation to match.

This is a LAN client connecting to the **user's own host**, so that exploit path
is low-likelihood to begin with.

**Entitlements** (`Glimmer/Glimmer.entitlements`, Release):

| Key            | Value | Why                                                                     |
| -------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app-sandbox`  | false | Unsandboxed - required to install/run the root AWDL helper (see above). |
| `cs.allow-jit` | false | No JIT.                                                                 |

Unsandboxed builds carry no `device.*` exceptions - those are sandbox
capabilities; raw-HID, networking, and file access all work without them once
unsandboxed. The Debug/adhoc variant (`Glimmer/Glimmer-Debug.entitlements`) adds
`cs.disable-library-validation` = true so a build that links the Homebrew
OpenSSL/Opus dylibs as-is can still load them; Release omits it (validation
enforced).

**NSWindow.sharingType** = `.none`. The stream window opts out of
ScreenCaptureKit, `screencapture(1)`, and Cmd-Shift-5. Third-party recording /
conferencing apps (QuickTime, OBS, Loom, Zoom, Teams) see a black surface where
the stream is - same posture as Apple TV+ and Netflix. Users who want to record
their session use the host PC's recording tools, not the Mac's.

## Sensitive material - what we don't log

- **Key characters from `keyDown` events.** Removed; previously logged at
  `.public`, leaked every keystroke (including passwords typed during a stream)
  into the unified log. We log `keyCode` (positional, non-PII) and the modifier
  mask only.
- **URLs containing `rikey`, `rikeyid`, `gcmkey`, `gcmkeyid`, `uuid`,
  `uniqueid`.** `NetworkClient.sensitiveQueryKeys` (`Network.swift`) is the key
  set; the launch-URL redaction that consumes it lives in
  `NetworkClient+Endpoints.swift`, and `dumpXMLRedacted` covers the response
  bodies.
- **Cert PEMs / fingerprints at `.public`.** `ControlTransport` logs a
  pin-mismatch event but not the fingerprints - a hostile log scraper could
  otherwise read the pinned cert via `log show`.
- **PIN values, AES keys, signed pairing-secret bytes.**

## Sensitive material - what we do log

- Scan codes + modifier masks (positional, non-PII; needed for responder-chain
  debugging).
- Network errors with sanitized URLs (rikey/gcmkey stripped).
- VT decode errors and codec configuration ints (`videoFormat=0x...`, `bytes=N`,
  `idr=true/false`).
- Host addresses at `.private` privacy (default).
- Pin-mismatch events (no fingerprints).
- Pairing-step transitions (no payload data).
