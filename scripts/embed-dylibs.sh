# embed-dylibs.sh - make a built Glimmer.app self-contained for distribution
#
# The Release build links openssl@3 (libssl + libcrypto) and opus from
# /opt/homebrew/opt/.../lib/*. Those paths don't exist on user machines,
# and even when they do, Hardened Runtime library validation rejects them
# because Homebrew's CI signs with a different Team ID than our adhoc app
# (so loading fails with "non-platform mapping with different Team IDs").
#
# This script:
#   1. Copies the three Homebrew dylibs into Glimmer.app/Contents/Frameworks/
#   2. Rewrites each dylib's install_name (id) to @rpath/<file>
#   3. Rewrites libssl's libcrypto reference to @rpath
#   4. Rewrites the main binary's three references to @rpath
#   5. Re-signs the embedded dylibs with the adhoc identity + runtime option
#   6. Re-signs the app bundle so its hashes match (entitlements preserved)
#
# Run after xcodebuild -configuration Release, before packaging the DMG.
#
# Args:
#   $1 - absolute path to Glimmer.app (Release build product)
#
# Requires `/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3` and `/opt/homebrew/opt/opus` to be
# present on the build machine. The CI host needs `brew install openssl@3 opus`
# the same as a development machine.
